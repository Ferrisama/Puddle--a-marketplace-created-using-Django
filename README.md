## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the Django Marketplace project! This open-source marketplace platform is built using Django, a high-level Python web framework, and provides a foundation for creating your own online marketplace. Whether you want to launch an e-commerce website, a classifieds platform, or any other type of marketplace, this project can be a great starting point.
